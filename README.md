# Programming_in_C
My answers to the exercises in Stephen G. Kochan's Programming in C (4th Edition)

A lot of the code adopted straight from the book. I'd be grateful for any corrections and improvements or tips and tricks as I am still early on my path to learn programming languages.

Plus I'm also hopeful that my answers can help out other newbies who also struggled to find answers to the chapter exercises! ;)
